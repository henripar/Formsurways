<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/react%20-%2320232a.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB"/> &nbsp;  
Survey maker application similar to Google forms.

## Setup

Before anything else in the project directory you should run:  

### `npm install`

This will install all the dependencies of the project.  

Then you are ready to start the server by running:  

### `npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Backend setup

To make this application work you must also have a backend for all the requests.

*I will link the REST API backend for the application here soon.*
